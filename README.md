# Trees Intro, Null vs. OOP

This repository contains in-class code from Lecture 06 (15 track) in Fall 2025. 

There are several approaches to solve the problem of representing tournaments:
* `Try1.java` builds `Round` records with only string fields.
* `Try15.java` (try 1.5) builds `Round` records with references to other `Round` objects. 
* `Try2.java` moves to classes, rather than records and encounters an issue.
* `Try3.java` replaces `null` with proper OO design.
